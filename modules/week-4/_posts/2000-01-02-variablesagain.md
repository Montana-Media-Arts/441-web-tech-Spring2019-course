# Variables again <br />


<br />

You might be asking yourself, why are we covering variables again?  Well, they are the cornerstone of programming so it's good to have a solid grasp on them.

What does that mean to us?

Remember from last week, that we can declare variable like this:

- var
- let
- const

Now, do you remember what those all mean?

If I were to ask you to create a program that were to get a user's name and then put it into a variable.  Do you think you could that? 

If not, that's okay!  I will show you how.

**video**

First, create a file called GetName.html.

Then, add a textbox into that file.

```html
<html>
    <body>
        <input id="txtName" type="text">
        <button id="btnSubmit">Submit</button>
    </body>
</html>
```

Now, open the file in your favorite browser (still hopefully Chrome).  Does it show a textbox and a button? Great!
