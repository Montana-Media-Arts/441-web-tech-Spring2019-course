## Continuation, Extension, and Assimilation

This week we are going to work on continuing the work that we began with the Canvas element.  If you recall, we have worked with classes, objects, jQuery, JSON, displaying, moving and colliding with other objects.  We will also use the array data structure to keep track of our objects.  So, how are we going to do this?  We are going to practice and practice some more!
