# Homework

In this homework, you are going to work with AJAX and jQuery.  You are going to have to learn a new concept on your own however.  I gave you tools to access a JSON file via AJAX in JavaScript and I also talked about access files using jQuery, but I didn't show you exactly how to access a JSON file using jQuery.  

However, I will not leave you high and dry and in fact, I will give you a hint -- a really big hint.  It's located here: [JQuery and JSON](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/ajax_getjson.asp)

You are going to choose from one of these data sets [Cool Datasets](https://github.com/jdorfman/awesome-json-datasets).  I suggest just copying the data from the page and creating a new page so that you have it locally and you don't have to worry about the cross-domain issue. From there, you are going to make something show up from the JSON. Your goal is to make it show up in a pleasing way that is easily understood by the end user. 

Also, you are going to create a simple yet workable jQuery plugin that you can apply to your dataset.

Technical Specifications:

1. Find a dataset to display
2. Use jQuery and AJAX to access the JSON file
3. Display your data in a meaningful way
4. Create a jQuery plugin that you can apply to your data as well.
