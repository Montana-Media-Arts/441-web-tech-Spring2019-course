## Phaser.io

This is our final week of our formal class.  If you choose, we will cover a new JavaScript library called Phaser.io.  It's a fun and lightweight library that allows you to create fun 2D games.  We are going to go through one of their introductory tutorials and then use that finished product to extend it a bit.
