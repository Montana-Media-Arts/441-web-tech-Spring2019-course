Active: {{ site.data.dates[page.module][0] }}

What is HTML5?  Simply put, HTML5 is the successor of HTML4.  This semester, we have been working primarily with HTML4 and that is great.  Those elements and tags still exist in HTML5.  However, HTML5 gives us a number new tags in which we can employ.  We will cover some of the new tags and how we can use them in our applications and will pay particular focus to the canvas tag as it will allow us to create web based games.
