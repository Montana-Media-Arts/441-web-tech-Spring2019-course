# Week 11 Homework

Catch me if you can!

In this assignment, you are going to full implement your two squares shapes. You are going to have one image chase the other.  You should prevent the user from going out of bounds and if the chaser hits the player the game is over. They should have 3 lives.  If they hit once, they should turn a different color.  If they are hit a second time, the color should change again, and if they are hit the third time, the game should be over.  You should have a timer that shows on the screen that indicates how long they have survived.  

Extra credit:

1. Have more than one enemy chase the player.
2. Create some obstacles that the player cannot go through
3. Create some collectibles that the player can gather.
